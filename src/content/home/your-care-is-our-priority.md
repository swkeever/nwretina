Patients can be referred to Dr. Osetinsky for their Vitreo-Retinal problems by their primary care physicians, ophthalmologist, and optometrist or may [call directly](/contact/) if you know you have a retina concern.

Together we will work with your doctor to provide you with the best possible care. We take pride in offering the highest quality in eye care in a friendly and professional atmosphere. Our office will strive to make sure you have a clear understanding of your retinal problems.
